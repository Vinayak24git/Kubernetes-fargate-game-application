# Kubernetes-fargate-game-application

Deploying a game application on Kubernetes using AWS Fargate has been an exciting journey for me. From setting up the environment to configuring the application load balancer and exposing the application externally, every step has been crucial in ensuring the smooth operation of my game application. Let's dive deeper into each step with detailed explanations and code snippets.

# Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment
Before diving into the deployment, I knew the importance of having the right tools at my disposal. My toolkit includes:

AWS CLI: Essential for interacting with AWS services. After installing it, I configured it with my AWS credentials to ensure secure access to my AWS resources.
kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line interface, which allows me to interact with my Kubernetes cluster. I made sure it was configured to communicate with my EKS cluster seamlessly.
eksctl: A handy tool for managing EKS clusters. I installed it using the commands provided and moved it to /usr/local/bin/ for easy access.

Install eksctl if you haven't already:

curl --silent --location "https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$(uname -s)_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo mv eksctl /usr/local/bin/

# Step 2: Creating an EKS Cluster with Fargate Support
With my environment set up, the next logical step was to create an EKS cluster that supports Fargate. Using eksctl, I executed the command to create a new cluster named game-app-cluster in my chosen AWS region. This cluster would serve as the backbone for hosting my game application.

Create a new EKS cluster with Fargate support enabled:
eksctl create cluster --name game-app-cluster --version 1.21 --region your-region --nodegroup-name standard-workers --node-type t3.medium --nodes 2 --managed


# Step 3: Configuring Fargate Profile
Once the cluster was up and running, I needed to associate a Fargate profile with it. This step ensures that my pods can leverage Fargate's serverless compute engine. I ran the eksctl command to link a Fargate profile named game-app-profile to my cluster, specifying the namespace as default.

After creating the cluster, configure a Fargate profile to allow your pods to run on Fargate:
eksctl utils associate-fargate-profile --cluster game-app-cluster --name game-app-profile --namespace default --region your-region


# Step 4: Deploying the Game Application
Having prepared my infrastructure, it was time to deploy my game application. Assuming I had a Docker image ready, I created a Kubernetes deployment YAML file (game-deployment.yaml). This file defined how many replicas of my game application should run and other configurations. Applying this YAML file with kubectl brought my game application to life within the Kubernetes cluster.

Deploy your application:
kubectl apply -f game-deployment.yaml

# Step 5: Configuring the Application Load Balancer
To distribute incoming traffic efficiently among my game application instances, I installed the AWS ALB Ingress Controller. This controller manages the Application Load Balancer (ALB) for my application, routing traffic based on the Ingress rules I define. I followed the quick start guide to install the controller and then created an Ingress resource (game-ingress.yaml) to specify how traffic should be routed to my game application.

Install the AWS ALB Ingress Controller:
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4.0/docs/installation/quickstart.yaml

# Step 6: Assigning an External IP to the ALB
The final step involved assigning an external IP to the ALB so that players could access my game application over the internet. By finding the external IP associated with the aws-load-balancer-controller service in the kube-system namespace, I was able to update my domain's DNS records to point to this IP. This step completed the loop, making my game application accessible to players worldwide.

First, find the ALB created by the AWS ALB Ingress Controller:
kubectl get svc -n kube-system

Look for the service named aws-load-balancer-controller. Note its external IP.

# Conclusion
Reflecting on this journey, deploying a game application on Kubernetes using AWS Fargate has been both challenging and rewarding. Each step, from setting up the environment to configuring the ALB and exposing the application externally, played a critical role in ensuring the success of my project. As I continue to refine and expand my game application, I'm excited about the possibilities that Kubernetes and AWS offer for scalability, reliability, and performance.
